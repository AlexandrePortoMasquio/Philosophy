# Hypotheses

Purpose: track open philosophical hypotheses and programmatic claims that are not yet proven or disproven, with clear status, arguments, evidence, and next steps.

Statuses
- open: under investigation; not established or refuted
- supported: provisionally favored by current arguments/evidence
- challenged: substantial counterarguments/evidence exist; needs revision
- refuted: considered false given arguments/evidence

Conventions
- One hypothesis per file, named `NNN-slug.md`.
- Keep entries concise (1â€“2 pages). Link to chapters/notes for detail.
- Update the `INDEX.md` when adding or changing status.

Workflow
1) Create from `TEMPLATE.md`.
2) Fill summary, claim, scope, arguments for/against, references, and concrete next steps.
3) When evidence shifts, update status and `updated:` date.

Notes
- This folder is meta-documentation; it does not assert truth of entries.
- You can keep speculative ideas here without interrupting the main text flow.

[[Bivalência Global]]
## Summary
- The hypothesis claims that every declarative sentence is either true or false (bivalence holds globally). This entry tracks arguments pro/con across precise mathematics, vagueness, and truth-theoretic paradoxes.

## Claim
- For all sentences P in the target language, exactly one of {P, ¬P} is true.

## Scope
- In scope: natural language semantics, mathematical discourse, truth predicates.
- Out of scope: dialetheic systems that reject explosion (treated separately if needed).

## Arguments For
- Mathematical discourse appears fully precise; arithmetic/law-of-identity reasoning is bivalent within standard models.
- Pragmatic success: treating assertions as true/false underwrites classical reasoning practices.

## Arguments Against
- Kripke fixed-point semantics for truth yields ungrounded sentences (e.g., the Liar) that are neither true nor false in the least fixed point.
- Supervaluationism for vagueness: borderline sentences lack a single truth value while `P ∨ ¬P` remains valid.
- Open future (branching time): future-tensed singulars can be indeterminate across histories.

## Predictions / Tests
- If global bivalence is correct, either: (a) exclude global truth predicates (Tarski hierarchy), (b) adopt epistemicism for vagueness, or (c) accept alternative logics/metasemantics that preserve bivalence but pay elsewhere.

## Next Steps
- Decide project stance: maintain bivalence in mathematics only, or globally with restrictions (e.g., no global truth predicate, epistemicism for vagueness).
- If rejecting countermodels: specify which assumptions are denied and why (cost–benefit rationale).

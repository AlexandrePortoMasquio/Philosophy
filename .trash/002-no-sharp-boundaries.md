## Summary
- The hypothesis states that ordinary vague predicates (e.g., heap, tall, bald) have no privileged sharp cutoffs; higher-order vagueness implies even the boundary between determinate and borderline cases is itself vague.

## Claim
- For natural-language vague predicates, there is no unique, correct sharp boundary; admissible precisifications form a range without a privileged member.

## Scope
- In scope: semantics of ordinary language, Sorites phenomena, higher-order vagueness.
- Out of scope: mathematics and stipulative definitions with exact identity conditions (treated as precise unless otherwise argued).

## Arguments For
- Sorites tolerance intuitions conflict with any single sharp cutoff.
- Supervaluationism models validity (LEM) while allowing borderline gaps; higher-order vagueness avoids sharp meta-boundaries.

## Arguments Against
- Epistemicism posits a sharp but unknowable cutoff; challenges are explanatory (why that boundary?) rather than logical.
- Fuzzy logics prefer graded truth over gaps; different explanatory trade-offs.

## Predictions / Tests
- Expect stability of classical reasoning at the metalogical level while rejecting universal tolerance premises that drive Sorites induction.

## Next Steps
- Add concise Sorites mini-model to Chapter 1 and link here.
- Decide if project endorses supervaluationism, fuzzy semantics, or a hybrid account.
